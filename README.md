# Turing 
A chat app that allows you to encrypt/decrypt the visible chat on screen by using AES and Caesar Cipher. It calls the Enigma API to do the AES on the chat text and uses Caesar Cipher written in JS on the front-end. This was done mainly to improve the speed of encryption/decryption in the app as AES is implemented by API calling which is an I/O bound task, and using cipher cipher from front-end facilitates a faster encryption. 
There's a question mark on the sidebar header for assisting the user with a general guidance on how to use the app.

## Improvements

I plan to make a much complex app with more features soon. This is more like a proof-of-concept for the higher end app that I would like to build in the foreseeable future.
